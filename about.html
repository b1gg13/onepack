                One Packet Initiative is a registered CBO in Kenya that works for
                menstrual hygine rights of women in Kenya. Our vision is to be in a
                future where mensturation won't be a hinder to any girl's dreams. We
                aim to to eradicate period poverty and stigma by creating menstrual
                health awareness and providing menstrual kits to needy girls across
                Kenya.

                    Creating awarenessis vital especially towards a cause that sees the
                    betterment of life for millions of girls. We created this cause to
                    tackle the issues many girls face in terms of having access to
                    sanitary towels. Some stories may seem distributing but it is a
                    reality that many face. The bottom line is together we can help
                    eradicate a situation hard to one girl by helping in the cause with
                    just one pack.
